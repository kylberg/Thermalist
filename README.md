# Thermalist
*An inexpensive thermal camera.*

## Background
I bought a Adafruit MLX90640 24x32 thermal camera module a couple of years ago. I recently got arount to interface with it from a Raspberry Pi via Python. Now with this repo I switch platform to ESP32 to create a handheld inexpensive thermal camera.  

## Parts list
- LILYGO TTGO ESP32 Module bought from Banggood
- Adafruit MLX90640 24x32 IR Thermal Camera Breakout - 110 Degree FoV
- LiPo battery
- 3D printed housing

This ESP32 module already got a lot already integrated including WiFi, Bluetooth, SD card reader, LCD and a few buttons!
